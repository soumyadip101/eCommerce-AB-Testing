# eCommerce-AB-Testing
This project demonstrates hypothesis testing and implementation of regression model on the results of an A/B test run on an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal of this project is to work through the given data to help the company understand if they should implement their new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
